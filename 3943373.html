            <article class="ept-page ept-column"><div class="page-paragraphs"><div data-paragraph-order="1" class="portfolio-paragraph " id='para_1072608'><div class='paragraph-text'><p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">      Through my education at SNHU I continued to set personal goals in order to stay focused and on the right track. Developing a pattern of creating personal goals is something that has stuck with me for a few years and it has helped me at work and in personal life. The goals are small and attainable and work towards a major overall goal. Goal setting is a practice that I have brought to my work life and it has also helped me in managing other employees and keeping everyone on the same track to the end goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">      I also enjoy learning and working with different programming languages. At my time at SNHU I was introduced to Java, C#, SQL and Python programming. I’ve been able to understand and create simple programs with the different languages and am excited to use them in the real world. It’s taken my sometime to understand, however with my courses and my own personal reading I’ve been able to understand much better. The prospect of using one of these languages in a professional environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">      I’ve always been upbeat and high energy at work. I think that when everyone is happy and laughing they work much better. I’ve always tried to bring joy to people that I interact with and try to look on the bright side of any issue. I enjoy communicating with people physically rather than over e-mail or text and bringing a smile to peoples faces. I also enjoy being someone that co-workers lean on in times of need. I like being in a leadership position and trying to bring out the best in everyone that I work with. I’m extremely hard-working and driven to be the best at anything that I do. I can learn quickly and enjoy listening and observing other people and their work techniques. I’m always trying to learn and be better at my job and am constantly striving for success in my personal and professional life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">      I’ve always been driven by my dream goal of being the lead developer or engineer for a major software development such as an app or new OS. I’ve always thought that entering the field of IT and software development could allow me to be part of a team that creates something that helps us as humans. Something like helping develop software to help send the first humans to Mars safely.  Being the leader of such a project is my vision and my mission. I demand strong ethics from the people that I work with and would want to ensure any team that I lead has a strong ethics stand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif;">      Overall my vision for me in the future is to become a developer that is well-known for completing high-quality projects that help millions of people. It’s not about becoming a wealthy developer, it’s about helping humanity and our species. For me it’s about being known as someone that helps create technology for people to make their lives better or easier. I want to be coveted by companies to come in and help work on a project because I have a strong reputation with strong ethics and an incredible work ethic. </span></p></div></div></div></article>
