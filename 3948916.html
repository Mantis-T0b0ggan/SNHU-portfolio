            <article class="ept-page ept-column"><div class="page-paragraphs"><div data-paragraph-order="1" class="portfolio-paragraph " id='para_1075865'><div class='paragraph-text'><p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em;">02 - Risk Analysis Document</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em;">The artifact that I chose for 02 and 03 was the risk mitigation plan I created for ABC Healthcare in IT-412 Cyberlaw and Ethics. In this project, I was asked to create a document which gave suggestions about internet access, data encryption, floor plan and acceptable use and password policy. The purpose of the artifact was to create a document which gave suggestions to mitigate risk currently found at ABC Healthcare as well as future risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em;">The risk mitigation plan was chosen because it displays my ability to make ethical business decisions that deal with network and information risk. The document has my own style to it as the suggestions made were ideas of mine based on the current state of ABC Healthcare. It also displays my ability to create a document which makes suggestions to comply with HIPPA and other healthcare laws as well as ethical information management. I think throughout the entire document one can see where my own personal style was included and where my personal ideas are. The floorplan was something that I created as well as the suggestions dealing with password policy and acceptable use policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em;">Creating this artifact was quite challenging when putting together because of the complexity of the HIPPA laws and other ethical views that were involved. However, in encountering the challenges I was able to understand how making ethical decisions dealing with sensitive information. This document shows that in the real world I can create a comprehensive document with many suggestions that deal with HIPPA and other laws. Also, my personal views in terms of suggesting actions to take to make more ethical decisions with customer and employee information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em;">As part of the risk mitigation document I was asked to create a power-point presentation to highlight the points in the document. This presentation was selected because it visually shows that I have the ability to create an effective presentation to visually show an audience my suggestions. I selected to add this presentation artifact because it displays my ability to create a presentation that’s appropriate for the audience. The presentation is quite short and straight to the point, so it is a solid representation of my presentation skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times; font-size: 16px; line-height: 2em;">In creating this presentation, I was able to learn how to summarize a document in a way that makes it easier and faster for people to understand. It was created as a bit of a training manual so it’s not overwhelming with information. Rather, it shows the highlights of the suggestions and gets straight to the point. This presentation shows that in the real-world if needed I can create a presentation that displays information from a large document and highlights key aspects. It also shows that I have skills with other forms of multimedia such as MS PowerPoint.</span></p></div></div><div data-paragraph-order="4" class="portfolio-paragraph " id='para_1075868'><div class='paragraph-text'></div><div class='portfolio-paragraph-artifact'><a title="]IT-412_finalProjectPresentation_Artifact03" href="Artifacts/Af_375180/]IT-412_finalProjectPresentation_Artifact03.pptx" class="artifact artifact-pptx"  id="artifactname_375180" >]IT-412_finalProjectPresentation_Artifact03</a></div></div></div></article>
