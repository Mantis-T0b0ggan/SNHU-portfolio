            <article class="ept-page ept-column"><h1>Home</h1><div class="page-paragraphs"><div data-paragraph-order="1" class="portfolio-paragraph " id='para_1075852'><div class='paragraph-text'><p>My name is Tim Ducharme, I am currently a Valet at a popular summer restaurant in Ogunquit Maine where I have worked for 7 fun filled seasons. Before the valet position, I was working at a car wash attendant making minimum wage and living with my parents. The valet position changed my life and allowed me the make enough money to put myself through school taking classes full-time as well as working full-time.  School was quite challenging at times and when I found myself stuck I often got up and walked around my apartment and talked to people on the phone that were knowledgeable with computer programming. There were times where I thought I wasn’t cut out for programming and that maybe I had made a mistake. I pushed through the negative thoughts and projects that I thought were impossible for me became very manageable and sometimes quite simple. The never say never mentality came to stick with me through my entire schooling at SNHU and has lead to numerous successes in classes and group projects.</p>
<p>As someone who started with very little and worked hard to make their way in life, I’ve always been fascinated by investing in new technologies and companies. I began researching cryptocurrencies in early 2016. I wanted to make a small investment and see where it goes with the overall goal of paying off student loans quickly if possible. 2 years and a lot of hours researching, reading and discussing with friends and co-workers and my investments have put me in a position where I can pay off my student loans and still have some left over. It’s something that I’m quite proud of and have helped other around me begin to invest into cryptocurrencies offering my opinion on certain investments. I enjoy seeing people around me making money and being genuinely happy about the possibility of bettering themselves.</p>
<p>Other hobbies of mine include sports both playing and watching. Though I don’t participate in the game of lacrosse anymore I love watching it live or on T.V. I’m also a die-hard Boston sports fan of the Patriots, Celtics, Red Sox and Bruins. Ever since the Celtics won the championship in 2008 I’ve told people “Hey KG told us ‘Anything’s possible’” from his infamous post-game interview. The video still gives me chills.</p>
<p>I’ve been known to have a good work-ethic and I believe that comes from my parents. Separated when I was very young however, both work extremely hard just to get by. My mom had to force her employer to give her hours to work during the winter in-order to make enough money. My father has worked the third-shift for 20 years simply because it pays a better rate than the normal day shift. I’ve grown up seeing them work their butts off just to get by and I knew from a young age that I would do whatever it took to work just as hard as them to not have to live paycheck to paycheck.</p></div></div><div data-paragraph-order="2" class="portfolio-paragraph " id='para_1075853'><div class='paragraph-text'></div><div class='portfolio-paragraph-artifact portfolio-paragraph-thumbnail' id='thumb_376901'><a title="Click to view full size" href="javascript:OpenCentered('Artifacts/Af_376901/Ya_Boii.jpg','450','675','true','image-only')" class="artifact artifact-thumbnail artifact-jpg" ><img  alt='Ya_Boii' src='Artifacts/Af_376901/Ya_Boii.jpg'></a></div></div></div></article>
